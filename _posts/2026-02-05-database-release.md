This release contains updates to the draft version of the database with FDA precision oncology approvals for Akeega. Additionally, the Organizations table was merged into the Agents table. 

## Database content updates
Added entries:
- (FDA) BRCA2 oncogenic and pathogenic variants and sensitivity to niraparib and abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.

Revised entries:
- (FDA) BRCA1/2 oncogenic and pathogenic variants and sensitivity to niraparib and abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was incorrectly listed as initially published in 2018 instead of 2023.

## New features
- The `description` written for each statement associated with an indication from the indications table will now populate the `description` field when dereferencing the database.
- The Agents and Organizations table were merged to align with VA-Spec.
