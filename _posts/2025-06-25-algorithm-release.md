title: Algorithm release 0.8.2
---
This release utilizes the [v.2025-02-07](https://github.com/vanallenlab/moalmanac-db/releases) release of the underlying MOAlmanac database. The codebase now supports Python 3.13 with no warnings produced, although we will continue officially using 3.12 for the time being.

Additions:
- [snfpy](https://github.com/rmarkello/snfpy) was removed as a dependency from the repository, with the relevant module imported with proper attribution. See [Pull Request #42](https://github.com/vanallenlab/moalmanac/pull/42) for more information.

Revisions:
- Several dependencies were updated to their latest versions, notably: 
    - matplotlib: 3.8.3 > 3.10.0
    - numpy: 1.26.4 > 2.3.0
    - requests: 2.31.0 > 2.32.4
    - scikit-learn: 1.4.2 > 1.7.0
    - scipy: 1.13.0 > 1.16.0
- Unit tests checking precise float values were modified to use assertAlmostEqual to 10 places.
