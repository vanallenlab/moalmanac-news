- (FDA) _ALK_ fusions and sensitivity to crizotinib for patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
- (FDA) _EGFR_ exon 20 insertions and sensitivity to amivantamab-vmjw in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
- (FDA) _EGFR_ exon 19 deletions or p.L858R and sensitivity to osimertinib in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
- (FDA) _EGFR_ exon 19 deletions or p.L858R and sensitivity to osimertinib for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

Revised entries:
- (FDA) _ALK_ rearrangement and sensitivity to crizotinib, updated publication date from 2016-06-01 to 2011-08-26.
- (FDA) _ALK_ fusion and sensitivity to crizotinib in patients with Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors (IMT), removed _EML4_ as a required fusion partner and updated publication date from 2022-07-01 to 2022-07-14.
- (FDA) _EGFR_ p.T790M and sensitivity to osimertinib, updated citation and publication date to reflect March 2017 approval (from accelerated approval) date for this indication.

The U.S. FDA also granted accelerated approval to [lifileucel for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-lifileucel-unresectable-or-metastatic-melanoma), but a drug label is not yet present for lifileucel. Our standard operating procedure was updated to no longer allow Abstracts as an evidence source for the knowledge base.
