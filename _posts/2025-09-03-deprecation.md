---
The Molecular Oncology Almanac cloud portal ([portal.moalmanac.org](https://portal.moalmanac.org)) is currently suspended, and perhaps deprecated, due to [Google Cloud's deprecation of the Life Sciences API](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/38412190391579-June-27-2025). It may be revisited at a future date. The algorithm continues to be available through [GitHub](https://github.com/vanallenlab/moalmanac) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanallenlab/moalmanac/).
