Added entries:
- (Preclinical) _ATM_ copy number deletions and sensitivity to talazoparib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _BAP1_ copy number deletions and sensitivity to talazoparib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _BARD1_ copy number deletions and sensitivity to talazoparib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _CCNE1_ copy number amplifications and sensitivity to dinaciclib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _CDK4_ copy number amplifications and sensitivity to palbociclib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _CHEK2_ copy number deletions and sensitivity to talazoparib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _FANCA_ copy number deletions and sensitivity to talazoparib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _FGFR1_ copy number amplifications and sensitivity to AZ4547 and PD173074 in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _MYC_ copy number amplifications and sensitivity to AT7519 in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _PTEN_ copy number deletions and sensitivity to MK-2206 and rapamycin in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _RB1_ somatic variants and sensitivity to olaparib and palbociclib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _TP53_ copy number deletions and sensitivity to talazoparib in osteosarcoma.
- (Preclinical) _TP53_ somatic variants and sensitivity to NSC59984 in osteosarcoma.

Revised entries:
- (FDA) _ERBB2_ amplifications in metastatic breast cancer were revised to list invasive breast carcinoma as the cancer type.
- (FDA) _TSC1_ and _TSC2_ somatic variants and sensitivity to everolimus in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma were revised to include Oncotree terms and codes. 
- (Preclinical) _AKT1_ somatic variants and p.E17K and sensitivity to MK-2206 were revised to include breast cancer as the Oncotree terms and code. The description was also updated for both cataloged relationships.
- (Preclinical) _ATM_ p.A1127D, c.2251-10T>G, and shRNA knockdown and sensitivity to olaparib was revised to update the doi of the underlying journal article and properly list the Oncotree code.
- (Preclinical) _CDKN2A_ copy number deletions and sensitivity to EPZ015666 was adjusted to inferential evidence because the underlying relationship is for MTAP deletions, which are commonly co-deleted with CDKN2A. 
- (Preclinical) _PTEN_ copy number deletions and somatic frameshift, nonsense, and splice site variants and sensitivity to AZD8186 were edited to add prostate cancer as the tumor type and the description was revised.
- (Preclinical) _RB1_ shRNA knockdowns and resistance to palbociclib in prostate cancer was revised to properly list the Oncotree code and term. 
- (Inferential) COSMIC mutational signature 10 and sensitivity to pembrolizumab and durvalumab was revised to list any solid tumor as the cancer type.

`publication_date` was also added for all revised entries.

Removed entries:
- (Preclinical) _PIK3CB_ and sensitivity to AZD8186.
