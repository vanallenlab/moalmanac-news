Added entries:
- (FDA) _RET_ fusions and sensitivity to selpercatinib in any solid tumor.

Revised entries:
- (Preclinical) _PPARGC1A_ knockdown with CRSPR-Cas9 and not favorable prognosis in melanoma was changed from the feature type Silencing to Knockdown.
- (Preclinical) _USP11_ knockdown with siRNA and sensitivity to olaparib in osteosarcoma was changed from the feature type Silencing to Knockdown.

Removed entries:
- (Clinical evidence) High Neoantigen Burden and sensitivity to pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer.
