This release utilizes the [v.2023-11-09](https://github.com/vanallenlab/moalmanac-db/releases/tag/v.2023-11-09) release of the underlying MOAlmanac database and incorporates changes from three pull requests: [#15: Added AIP to hereditary cancers gene list](https://github.com/vanallenlab/moalmanac/pull/15), [#16: Update db nov 2023](https://github.com/vanallenlab/moalmanac/pull/16), and [#17: Revise handling of COSMIC mutational signatures](https://github.com/vanallenlab/moalmanac/pull/17). 

Additions:
- Added _AIP_ to genes related to hereditary cancers gene list. 
- All entries within the MOAlmanac database now have filled fields for `publication_date` of the source and when the record was `last_updated`. 
- `moalmanac/moalmanac.py` now accepts `--mutational_signatures` as an input argument and an example input as been added.  

Revisions:
- MOAlmanac no longer runs deconstructSigs as a subprocess and, as a result, R dependencies have been removed. 
- The annotation to the MOAlmanac database was updated to sort by the evidence type, publication date of the source, and then when the database record was last updated.
